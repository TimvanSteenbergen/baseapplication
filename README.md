# Base Application
An great starter application to build on.

## Description

Starting with Mendix is usually done using a blank template. If instead you use this base application:
* You get a lot of extra's for your application- and user management, so you need not spend any time on that;
* You get address and country entities implemented in the most complete and performant way possible;
* You get to send emails without doing any setup;
* You get PWA-pages setup ready to go;
* You get to switch between Demo user accounts, getting a feel for each userrole your team created;
* Your administrator gets to query your database using OQL;
* You get a multi-tenant environment for companyfunctions;
* You get basic invoice functions;
* You get to play games like 2048 and tictactoe. Good fun and showing you React-addons at the same time;

And all that Out-Of-The-Box!

## Persons and user accounts
A very intuitive administration of persons and their information like addresses, user-accounts, family-relations, socialmedia-accounts and their roles.
And at the top right: your profile image telling you all about who you are, your userrole(s) and sign-out and password change buttons.

## System management
An extended toolset for your system management, giving you more grip on the application, showing currently logged in users, and the number of objects in the entities that you want to keep in focus. Also: showing a system message to your logged in users.

## Dependencies
Since this example contains all the code it needs, there are no dependencies
